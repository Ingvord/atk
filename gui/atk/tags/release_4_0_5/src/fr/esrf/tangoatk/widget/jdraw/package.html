Provides classes for handling synoptic files generated by the ESRF home made
tool JDraw.

This package is used to handle a JDraw file (.jdw) as a generic Tango Syoptic.
Note that the Jloox files (.jlx) produced by the commercial tool JLooxMaker
are also supported.

Using the JDraw graphical editor, the user can design
a synoptic drawing. During this drawing phase, the portions of the drawing are
called with names which can be : tango device names, tango device attribute names
or tango device command names.

This package provides classes to view and animate the drawing file at run time
in a Tango ATK application.
