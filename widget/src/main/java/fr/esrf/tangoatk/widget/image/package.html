This package contains a simple image viewing facility. It is
represented by certain interfaces, and some of these are implemented
to treat the simplest of cases.
<p>
There are three concepts to this package:
<ol>
<li>the viewer represented by the interface IImageViewer
<li>the raster-controller, represented by the interface IRasterControl
<li>the image-manipulator, represented by the interface IImageManipulator
    (and its subinterface IImageManipulatorPanel)
</ol>

<h2>The image viewer</h2>
The concept of the imageviewer is to be the one that distributes
information. Basically it's given an image produced by someone,
normally a IRasterControl, through its <code>image</code> property.
This <code>image</image> is passed along to all
its <code>IImageManipulator</code>'s which can treat this image in any
way they want before it's drawn in the viewer.


<h2>The raster conversion</h2>
The IRasterConverter interface is provided so that an IImageViewer can
take a raster, basically an <code>double [][]</code>, and make it
into an <code>BufferedImage</code>. <code>convertRaster(double [][]
raster)</code> in <code>IRasterConverter</code> is called each time the
image-viewers <code>setRaster(double [][])</code> is called. 

<h2>The image manipulators</h2> The IImageManipulator interface is
provided so that an image that is to be drawn by an IImageViewer can
be manipulated. <code>IImageManipulator</code>'s can be added to
the <code>IImageViewer</code> via
the <code>addImageManipulator(IImageManipulator)</code> call. One can
have image-manipulators which take input from a user, for this, the
interface IImageManipulatorPanel is used. When an object implementing
this interface is passed to
an <code>IImageViewer</code>s <code>addImageManipulator</code> method,
it is expected that the object implementing <code>IImageViewer</code>
adds it to its control-panel, if such functionality is supported.
